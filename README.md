# SIT E-boat Shore Server

## About The Project

This program is the server side of the shore computer program. It is what the boat connects and sends data to. This application will then store that data in a database and propagate it to all connected clients.

See [Stevens-Electrical-Boatworks/shore-client](https://github.com/Stevens-Electric-Boatworks/shore-client) for the client side of the shore computer.

### Built With

- Express.js
- Prisma

## Getting Started

This section will help you download, build, and run the program for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that `node.js` is installed on your system:

```
node -v
```

If it is not, consider checking out a Node version manager such as [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Instructions on how to set up each of them are included in their respective READMEs.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local system:

```
git clone https://github.com/Dakdot/eboat-server.git
```

2. Install `npm` packages:

```
npm i
```

3. Generate Prisma sources:

```
npx prisma generate
```

### Running & Building

#### Development

The easiest way to get the program running now is simply to run:

```
npm run dev
```

This command uses `nodemon-ts` to run the program and will automatically restart the server once you make changes to any files, ideal for development.

#### Production

To build the server for production, run:

```
npm run build
```

To run it, enter the `dist` directory and run:

```
node index.js
```

### Creating a Docker image

Simply run:

```
docker build .
```

### GitHub Actions

This repository is set up with some automatic GitHub Actions workflows.

- A Docker image will automatically be built upon every commit.
